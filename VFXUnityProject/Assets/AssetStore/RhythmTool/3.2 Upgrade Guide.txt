Version 3.2 introduces a few changes that might require some changes to be made to your project.

The most significant change is that RhythmData now directly references an AudioClip and the RhythmPlayer can no longer be given an AudioClip. 
In instances where you give a RhythmPlayer a RhythmData and an AudioClip, simply remove the line where you assign the AudioClip.
